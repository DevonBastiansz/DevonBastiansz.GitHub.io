            <h2>Olive Ridley Turtle<br>(<i>Lepidochelys olivacea</i>)</h2><br>
            <p>Also known as the Pacific Ridley Sea Turtle, this is the secon-smallest and most commonly found species of all sea turtles. Females nest 1-3 times per season,
                laying around 100 eggs at a time. These eggs incubate for about 50-60 days.
                With around 800,000 nesting females (anually), the Olive Ridley turtle can be found in abundance in warm, tropical oceans such as the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
                Adults are relatively small at 0.6-0.7 metres in length and weigh around 45 kilograms. The largest of this species are observed on the Pacific coast of Mexico.
                They can dive upto depths of 200 metres in search of food and they feed on invertebrates such as sea urchins, 
                crabs, jellyfish, fish eggs and adult fish.<br><br>Despite being the most commonly found species of turtles, many Olive Ridley hatchlings
                do not make it back to the sea due to their nests being dug up by predators such as raccoons, coyotes, snakes and of course, humans. The ones that survive these dangers 
                may live upto 50 years. The Olive Ridley is listed as a threatened and endangered species under the Endangered Species Act.

            <h2>Leatherback Turtle<br>(<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>)</h2><br>
            <p> The Leatherback Turtle is the largest sea turtle found on Earth. Adult Leatherbacks can grow upto 8 feet in length and weigh upto 900 kilograms! They are named after their tough, rubbery skin and is the only species of sea
                turtle that lacks a hard shell and scales. Leatherbacks can dive as deep as 4000 feet and are highly migratory, some migrating over 10,000 miles anually
                between nesting and foraging grounds. They are commonly found to be nesting in tropical beaches, 5-7 times a season. Eggs could take 70-80 days to hatch.<br><br> Leatherback turtles feed on creatures such as jellyfish, squid and shrimp. 
                Even though Leatherbacks have fewer natural threats 
                because of their large size compared to other animals, their newborn hatchlings and eggs are preyed upon by birds, raccoons and snakes. The lifespan of a 
                leatherback turtle is about 50 years and they are listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act.

            <h2>Green Sea Turtle<br>(<i>Chelonia mydas</i>)</h2><br>
            <p>The Green Sea Turtle is the largest species of hard-shelled turtle. An adult green turtle can grow upto 4 feet in length and weigh as much as 150 kilograms.
               They nest in over 80 countries and can be commonly spotted in tropical/ sub-tropical waters and specifically in the Pacific Ocean, which explains why they are also known as Pacific Green Turtles. 
               Their eggs may take 45-75 days to hatch depending on the surrounding temperature. The largest nesting population of Green Tutles can be found on the coast of Raine Island on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
                Green turtles can be recognized by their distinct grey or olive colored shells and their yellowish white underbelly.<br><br>
                Being herbivorous by nature, a green turtles diet consists of seagrass and algae though they may occasionally feed on invertebrates as well. 
                While Green Turtle hatchlings have a higher risk of predation than adults, once they reach adulthood they can live at least 70 years of life. The Green Turtle too, is 
                listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act.

            <h2>Hawksbill Turtle<br>(<i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>)</h2><br>
            <p>
                Found entirely in tropical and sub-tropical marine ecosystems, the Hawksbill sea turtle is a critically endangered species of turtle. They have a beak-like mouth resembling the beak of a hawk which explains the 
                origin of the name 'Hawksbill'.Their beak-shaped jaws allow them to reach food that are hidden in tight crevices and coral reefs. Hawksbills are omnivorous creatures and they mainly feed on jellyfish, marine algae 
                and crustaceans. They are found in the west Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans and often nest in small groups. Hawksbills lay around 3-5 nests per season, each containing about 130-160 eggs. The eggs may take 50-75 
                days to hatch depending on the weather. Adult turtles can weigh upto 70 kilograms and 2-3.5 feet in length and may live about 50 years.<br><br> Hawksbill turtles are critically endangered due to several reasons.
                Vulnerable eggs and hatchlings are preyed upon by crabs and birds and also captured by humans. Adult turtles face threats such as sharks and being captured in fishing nets and marine debris. They also face the unique 
                threat of being hunted for their shell, which is used to craft jewellery.

            <p>
                Loggerhead turtles are named after their large head, which holds a strong jaw that enable them to feed on hard-shelled prey such as conch. They also consume creatures such as jellyfish, sea anemone and barnacles. 
                Fully grown Loggerheads can span upto 0.9 metres and can weigh upto 150 kilograms. Oman and South Florida hosts the largest nesting beaches recorded with over 10,000 females nesting anually. Loggerhead turtle eggs hatch 
                about 60 days after they are laid and it depends on the depth and the surrounding temperature of the eggs. The average lifespan of a loggerhead is about 50-80 years.<br><br> Loggerhead Turtles are listed as an endangered 
                species in the Endangered Species Act. Eggs and hatchlings are more vulnerable and are preyed upon by snakes birds and humans while adult turtles are preyed upon by sharks seals and whales. But the biggest predator of the 
                loggerhead turtle remains to be fishing gear, nets and ocean pollution.
