<u>1. Incidental capture by fishing gear (bycatch)</u><br><br>
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), bycatch in fishing gear is a widespread threat to the sea turtle population around the world.
A staggering amount of non-target marine life is hauled up in fishing nets and other fishing equipment every single day. Longlines, trawls and gillnets can be cited as culprits for bycatch.
Turtles get trapped in the nets and die from drowning as they are unable to reach the surface for air. Another method of bycatch is turtles accidentally swallowing large fishing hooks.
 Modern fishing equipment covering an extensive surface area at a given time, can be observed as the main reason for bycatch. Poor regulation of fishing nets and equipment by 
 some countries has made the situation worse. It is estimated that a staggering 250,000 sea turtles die anually as bycatch. <br><br> Even though bycatch cannot be fully prevented, it can 
 be reduced by a considerable margin by different innovations in the fishing gear industry. Development of circular hooks instead of traditional J-shaped fishing hooks and training fishermen to 
 safely release sea turtles back to the ocean can be shown as examples.

    <u>2. Marine pollution</u><br><br>
    Oceans getting contaminated by man made substances such as polythene, plastic or chemicals such as petroleum and pesticides, can be defined as Marine pollution.
    It is estimated aound 1,000 sea turtles die anually by ingesting plastic alone. The main cause of this is sea turtles confusing plastic/polythene for jellyfish,
    which is one of their favorite food. Various chemical effuents from ships and fishing boats also contribute to this issue. Marine pollution also weakens the immune 
    system of the turtles, disrupt their nesting behavior and hatching variations too. The pollution of nesting beaches by trash is also a main segment of this threat.
    <br><br> As humans, we can contribute in preventing this threat by not littering beaches and refraining from polluting the ocean and/or all the aquatic ecosystems 
    that lead to the ocean. We can reuse plastic products and reduce the wastage that reaches the marine ecosystem. Participating in beach clean-ups is another way to contribute.

        <u>3. Climate change</u><br><br>
        Heating up of the Earth's atmosphere by UV rays of the sun due to the depletion of the Ozone layer can be summarized as climate change. Climate change affects
        turtles in many ways as they are cold blooded animals. Climate change causes the sea level to rise due to the melting of glaciers, while also increasing the waters temperature.
        Warm waters will disrupt ocean current patterns, potentially leading turtles to dangerous borders within the ocean while also destroying coral reefs which are turtle habitats.
        Heating up of nesting beaches also raises a threat to unhatched turtle eggs and young hatchlings who are finding their way to the ocean. Rising sea levels also causes beaches to erode, 
        destroying nesting grounds. As atmospheric temperature is key in determining the gender of a turtle, a shortage in male hatchlings has risen, threatening the continuity of the species.
        <br><br>It is estimated that around 4,600 sea turtles succumb to climate change, anually. Combatting climate change by switching to sustainable energy sources and products is the best remedy
        to keep the turtle population from going extinct. Using sustainable products will reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and heal the Ozone layer, and ultimately cool down the Earth.
